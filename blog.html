    We worked on active directory. you may be asking What is activ directory? 
    <br>
    Active directory is a system to add users to a sever and grant permissions as wellas managing the devices on the network
    <br>
    we also talked about why centralised management a more secure option.
    <br>
    it stops moltiball sights that have difrent protocalls and needing more resorces to set them all up.

1. download an ISO fille to make a virtual machine of what we want to run on them  
<br>
2. the first virtual machine we made was a windows directory and change the adapter from NAT to bridged and booted up  
<br>
3. after it started to run and made it look like a standard windows computer for ease of use and set a password for the administers account  
<br>
4.after logging in and aces the local server and go into the ethernet tab and click on IPv4 Address Assigned by DHCP 
<br>
5.then right-click on Ethernet network adapter then click on properties then select Internet protocol version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and then click on Properties 
<br>
6.then set the IP to static so that it would be the same every time the virtual machine will be turned on  
<br>
7.we then set up a new operational unit (OUs)so we could add users to the system without making them an administrator  
<br>
8. we then made a new user on the now OUs to use in the Futcher to test if it we have set it up properly 
<br>
9.we then made and run windows 10 virtual machine and made it run windows 10 pro so that we don’t need a windows activation code and set a bridged adapter and a static IP
<br>
10.we set the window 10 virtual machine, so it first tries to find information form the windows directory and if it can’t, it will try the router 
<br>
11.we then tried to log in with the test account after setting it up to check if we did it properly, but we forgot the password 
<br>
12. After changing the password in the windows directory, we tried again, and it worked
